## Uploaded coursework from the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization on Tensorflow 2 from Imperial College London.  https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning

Skills covered:
-The Sequential API
-Validation, Regulation, Callbacks
-Saving and Loading Models 

Also includes a Capstone Project 
## Image classifier for the SVHN dataset

Instructions

In this notebook, you will create a neural network that classifies real-world images digits. 
You will use concepts from throughout this course in building, training, testing, validating and saving your Tensorflow classifier model.

Loss: 0.6889 - acc: 0.7838 for the CNN model but did not seek optimal results in this capstone. Model only ran for 8 epochs but results could

have improved with more computing power and more time to train.
